 <img src='Images/heroku.png' width=70 height=35></h1>

 >Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. It is generally considered to be easy-to-use. But itâ€™s most beneficial to businesses in specific situations. Heroku has a free service model for small projects, but tiered service packages exist for cases where more complex business needs must be addressed.

> In this Repo I implemented  Prediction of salary using Linear Regression and deployed to Heroku.

<h2>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h2>
<h3>1. Create a Directory Containing FlaskApp, Index.html and requirements.txt </h3>
<p> <b>NOTE &nbsp; : </b>  &nbsp; To generate requirements .txt , go to path in command prompt or Terminal and type <b><i>pipreqs</i></b>

>Add These in your  &nbsp; <i>requirements.txt  </i>   &nbsp; as these ensure proper deployment in Heroku cloud.

```
gunicorn==19.9.0
itsdangerous==1.1.0
Jinja2==2.10.1
MarkupSafe==1.1.1
Werkzeug==0.15.5
```

<h3> 2. Create a Procfile</h3>

>A Procfile is a list of process types in an app.

```
web: gunicorn app:app
```
>The first app represents the name of the python file that runs your application or the name of the module it is in. The second app represents your app name.

<p> <b> In My repo My python  name is app.py and application name is app.</b></p>

<p><b> Upload These Files in Git Repo </b></p>

```
model.pkl
app.py 
requirements.txt 
Procfile 
templates 
```


<h3> 3. Open Heroku clock create new and select app</h3>
<p> Give a name to your app and create</p>
<h3> 4. Connect to github and select Your Repo.</h3>
